# Trained Models Storage

## Overview

Due to file size limitations imposed by GitHub, the trained autoencoder models produced in this project are **not stored directly in the repository**. 

To ensure **reproducibility and accessibility**, all trained models are stored externally using Google Drive.

---

## Model Access

- All trained models can be accessed at the following link:

  - **Google Drive – Trained Autoencoder Models** | https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1XZWhbIda4SUKPtnpPdn74YEK7cvaSRhw

### Contents:
  - Saved model weights 
  - Different directories for each type of AE
  - Naming conventions to easily identify the model

---

## Usage Notes

- Models are saved in formats compatible with **TensorFlow / Keras**.
- To load a model, the corresponding architecture definition must be available.

---

## Reproducibility Statement 
External storage of model files is used due to size constraints and does not affect the user. The same models that are seen in the notebooks can be found here along the data used.
